									<h3 class="media-heading"> INTRODUCTION </h3>
									<p> Originally from Bangladesh, I came to Canada in 2023 to 
										begin my undergraduate studies at Thompson Rivers University. 
										In September 2024, I transferred to the University of Victoria 
										to pursue a Bachelor of Engineering in Biomedical Engineering. 
										I'm currently in my second year of the program. Outside of academics, 
										I enjoy reading, photography, and exploring different cuisines.

									<h3 class="media-heading"> SKILLS </h3>
									<p>I bring a well-rounded set of skills in communication, design, and technical tools. 
										My customer service experience and academic writing courses have helped me develop 
										strong verbal and written communication abilities. Through engineering courses and 
										hands-on projects, I've gained practical design experience and solid problem-solving 
										skillsâ€”especially using tools like SolidWorks and Microsoft Office especially MS Excel.
										I've also worked closely with internal teams, IT support, and customers, which strengthened 
										my collaboration and time management. Additionally, I'm comfortable with data analysis and 
										research methods, and I've recently started learning the basics of web design using html 
										and css to expand my creative and technical toolkit.

									<h3 class="media-heading"> EXPERIENCE AND PROJECTS </h3>
									<p>
										My work experience at London Drugs has given me a strong foundation 
										in both technical and administrative tasks, including maintaining 
										point-of-sale systems, coordinating with IT for software deployments, 
										and managing store pricing and funds. These responsibilities helped 
										sharpen my problem-solving, organization, and time management skills. 
										In a leadership role on my school's debate team, I developed skills 
										in communication, event planning, and coaching, while also becoming 
										proficient with tools like Microsoft Office for data and presentation tasks. 
									</p>
									<p>
										Worked on a team project to design a smart hospital system for a design class using a 
										Raspberry Pi Pico W, sensors, and a custom HTML interface. I contributed to sensor 
										integration, MicroPython coding, and UI development, with the system responding to 
										real-time data through both physical and virtual actuators.
										Most recently, I've started a personal web design project to showcase 
										my resume and interests online. This has allowed me to explore HTML, 
										CSS, and GitHub for version control and publishing, reflecting both 
										creativity and a willingness to learn new technologies.
